# Text-Summarization
For generating the summary of the given text of the document, a transformer-based approach was used. It was a pre-trained model of BART. BART is the seq2seq model for the summarization of text. Experimentation was carried out on different types of data and it was found to be performed satisfactorily.

This app provide you:
 - Takes url, text , doc or pdf as a input
 - Displays Summarized text
 
 The web app was created for this experimentation using Streamlit. Streamlit is free and open-source framework to create web apps. Streamlit framework is based on Python Programming Language. This framework is specially designed for Data Scientists and Machine Learning enthusiasts for easily creating web apps for their projects without any dependency on web developers.
